# Universal Health Coverage and Preparedness Pay Off: COVID-19 Vaccination Dataset

## Study Overview
This repository contains the processed dataset used for the study "Universal Health Coverage and Preparedness Pay Off: Global COVID-19 Vaccination Rates" by Rasooly et al. The study examines the relationship between countries' preparedness indicators (Universal Health Coverage index and State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting index) and COVID-19 vaccination rates across 183 countries globally.

## Dataset Description
The file `UHC_Preparedness_Dataset.csv` contains the processed dataset combining data from multiple sources for analysis. The dataset includes:

- COVID-19 vaccination rates (October 2021 and August 2022)
- Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index
- State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) index
- Country income classification
- Population demographics (percentage of population aged 65 and above)

## Variable Definitions
- **Vaccination Rate**: Percent of the population who received all doses prescribed by the initial vaccination protocol in each country
- **SPAR**: Average score of the SPAR's 13 capacities from WHO's International Health Regulations monitoring framework
- **UHC index**: Average scores of the UHC's four sub-indices measuring service coverage
- **Population above 65**: Percent of population above age 65
- **Country income classification**: Divided by four income groups (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high)
